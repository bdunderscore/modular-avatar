## [Unreleased]

### Added
- (Experimental feature) Enabled support for non-VRC platforms

### Fixed
- [#1587] The Mesh Settings gizmo was not shown when in `SetOrInherit` mode

### Changed

### Removed

### Security

### Deprecated

## [1.12.5] - [2025-04-14]

### Fixed
- [#1555] Fixed compatibility regression from 1.11.x: VRC Animator Play Audio, when configured with an absolute path
  but merged with a relative-path merge animator component, will now detect that the indicated object does not
  exist, and treat the reference as an absolute path.
  - Note that if there is an object in the target path, then it will be treated as a relative path. Using
    addressing for Play Audio behaviors consistent with Merge Animator settings is therefore recommended as it will be
    more robust.
- [#1558] Fixed an issue where Merge Animators animating transforms in the base avatar's armature would break.
- Update NDMF dependency
  - Fixed an issue where duplicate layer entries in the VRChat Avatar Descriptor would cause all animator contents
    to be ignored.
  - Fixed a benign `NullReferenceException` at initialization
  - Fixed a NullReferenceException in AnimationIndex
  - Fixed an issue where animation curve paths being rewritten multiple times might be deleted

## [1.12.4] - [2025-04-10]

### Fixed
- [#1552] Merge Blend Tree failed to correct parameter types when the main avatar FX layer contained an int or bool
  parameter with the same name as one used in the blend tree.
- [#1553] Reactive components might generate states with incorrect write default settings

### Changed
- [#1551] Merge Animator will always set WD ON for single-state blendtree layers with no any state transitions.
  - This fixes compatibility issues with assets which relied on the prior behavior.

## [1.12.3] - [2025-04-05]

### Fixed
- Fixed issues with additive layers (via NDMF version upgrade)

### Changed
- [#1542] Merge Animator now will match WD settings for layers with a single state containing an animation clip,
  but not if it contains a blend tree. This fixes some compatibility issues introduced in 1.12 (where the behavior
  was changed to not match WD settings for single-state animation clips).
- [#1551] Merge Animator will always set WD ON for single-state blendtree layers with no any state transitions.

## [1.12.2] - [2025-04-03]

### Fixed
- [#1537] Curves which animated animator parameters, when added using a `Merge Motion` component, would not be updated by
  `Rename Parameters`

## [1.12.1] - [2025-04-02]

### Fixed
- [#1532] Modular Avatar has compiler errors in a newly created project

## [1.12.0] - [2025-04-01]

### Added
- Added CHANGELOG files
- [#1482] Added support for replacing pre-existing animator controllers to `Merge Animator`
- [#1481] Added [World Scale Object](https://m-a.nadena.dev/docs/reference/world-scale-object)
- [#1489] Added [`MA MMD Layer Control`](https://modular-avatar.nadena.dev/docs/general-behavior/mmd)

### Fixed
- [#1460] When importing parameter assets in MA Parameters, "local only" parameters were incorrectly treated as
  "animator only"
- [#1489] Fixed compatibility issues between `Merge Blend Tree` or reactive components and MMD worlds.
  - See [documentation](https://modular-avatar.nadena.dev/docs/general-behavior/mmd) for details on the new handling.
  - To disable this behavior, attach the new `MA VRChat Settings` component to any object on your avatar and disable the appropriate setting.
- [#1501] Unity keyboard shortcuts don't work when editing text fields on the MA Parameters component 
- [#1410] Motion overrides on synced layers are not updated for Bone Proxy/Merge Armature object movement
- [#1504] The internal `DelayDisable` layer no longer references unnecessary objects in some situations
  - This helps improve compatibility with AAO and other tools that track whether objects are animated 
- [#1508] Fix an issue where automatic compression of expressions menu icons would fail when the texture dimensions were
  not divisible by four.
- [#1513] Expression menu icon compression broke on iOS builds

### Changed
- [#1529] `MA Parameters` auto-rename and `MA Menu Item`'s automatic parameter feature now assign names based on the
  path of the object. This should improve compatibility with `MA Sync Parameter Sequence`
  - If you are using `MA Sync Parameter Sequence`, it's a good idea to empty your SyncedParams asset and reupload all
    platforms after updating to this version.
- [#1514] `Merge Blend Tree` is now `Merge Motion (Blend Tree)` and supports merging animation clips as well as blend trees
- [#1476] Switch ModularAvatarMergeAnimator and ModularAvatarMergeParameter to use new NDMF APIs (`IVirtualizeMotion` and `IVirtualizeAnimatorController`)
- [#1483] The Merge Animator "Match Avatar Write Defaults" option will no longer adjust write defaults on states in
  additive layers, or layers with only one state and no transitions.
- [#1429] Merge Armature will now allow you to merge humanoid bones with PhysBones attached in certain cases.
  - Specifically, child humanoid bones (if there are any) must be excluded from all attached Physbones. 
- [#1437] Create Toggle for Selection now creates submenus as necessary when multiple items are selected, and creates toggles as children.
- [#1499] When an audio source is controlled by an Object Toggle, disable the audio source when animations are blocked
  to avoid it unintentionally being constantly active.
- [#1502] `World Fixed Object` now uses `VRCParentConstraint` and is therefore compatible with Android builds
