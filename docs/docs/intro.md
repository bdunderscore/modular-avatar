# Modular Avatar

Modular Avatar is a suite of **non-destructive** tools for modularizing your avatars, and for distributing avatar
components.
With Modular Avatar, adding a new outfit or gimmick to your avatar is as easy as drag-and-drop!

Modular Avatar's features are packaged as individual components, which can be added as needed. You can opt-in to just the features
you want to use. It can automatically merge outfits onto your avatar, build an animator out of multiple components, and much more.
