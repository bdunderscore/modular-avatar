# Modular Avatar

Modular Avatar is a suite of **non-destructive** tools for modularizing your avatars, and for distributing avatar
components.
With Modular Avatar, adding a new outfit or gimmick to your avatar is as easy as drag-and-drop!

Modular Avatar's features are packaged as individual components, which can be added as needed. You can opt-in to just the features
you want to use. It can automatically merge outfits onto your avatar, build an animator out of multiple components, and much more.

To install Modular Avatar, download and import the `unitypackage` file from the "Assets" section on [the latest release](https://github.com/bdunderscore/modular-avatar/releases).

Then, check out one of the tutorials below:
* [Simple clothing setup](tutorials/clothing/)
* [Advanced clothing setup](tutorials/adv_clothing/)
* [Toggling an object](tutorials/object_toggle/)

You can also check out some of the [detailed reference documentation](reference) on individual components.

Finally, if you are developing your own prefabs using Modular Avatar, check out the [page on prefab distribution](distributing-prefabs).
