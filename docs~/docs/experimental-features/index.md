# Experimental features

Modular Avatar (and NDMF) contain a number of experimental features that are disabled by default.
These features are still in active development, and their behavior might change in the future.
They may not be fully documented yet.

:::warning

Experimental features might change in ways that are not backward compatible.
This means that if you use an experimental feature, you might need to update your avatar
or assets in the future to keep them working.

## Enabling experimental features

Before enabling experimental features, make sure you have the latest (beta) version of Modular Avatar and NDMF. See the [installation instructions](intro#betas) for more information.

To enable experimental features, open "Tools -> NDM Framework -> Experimental Features" in the menu bar.
This will open a window where you can enable or disable experimental features.
