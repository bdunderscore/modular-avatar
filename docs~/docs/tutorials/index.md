Here are some step-by-step guides on how to set up things using Modular Avatar.

* [Configuring a simple outfit](/docs/tutorials/clothing/) - in most cases, you can set up an outfit with just a few clicks. Check out this tutorial for details.
* [Configuring a complex (cloth) outfit](/docs/tutorials/adv_clothing/) - this tutorial shows an example of an outfit that requires just a little bit more setup
* [Toggle an object](/docs/tutorials/object_toggle/) - In this tutorial we'll build a simple toggle to turn on and off
  an item of clothing.
  * In the [advanced toggles tutorial](/docs/tutorials/advanced-toggles/), we'll show you how to update blendshapes when
    toggling objects as well.
  * You can also do this by [building an animator manually](/docs/tutorials/object_toggle_manual/), but why would you?
* [Edit menus](/docs/tutorials/menu/) - This tutorial shows you how to use the modular avatar menu system to easily edit your avatar's menus
